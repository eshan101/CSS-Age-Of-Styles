# CSS: Age of Styles

# Learn CSS by Doing — No Lectures, Just Hands-On!

**Welcome to the CSS: Age of Styles** This repository is designed for anyone ready to dive deep into CSS by getting their hands dirty with practical coding. It’s **100% beginner-friendly**, so no worries if you're just starting out—though knowing basic HTML will help (check out my [HTML Essentials Repository](https://github.com/eshan101/html-essentials) for that).

I’ve packed it with industry-level insights, the best learning examples, and some projects that’ll make CSS stick. You'll leave this experience with knowledge that goes beyond notes and lectures.
